# Battleship Game | Vanilla JavaScript
This is my final for IS30A at Clovis Community College. I built a Battleship game with vanilla JavaScript. 

## Instructions

Use the context menu to fire a torpedo on the grid. The grid is outlined below. Type in A1-A6, down to D1-D6. And for a hint, use Developer Tools and the console to type in `` and it will show you the arrays for where they are located.

## Conclusion

This was a fun project to do. I created this project for my IS30A Final at Clovis Community College, and I also helped several students with the final as well. 

Lastly, if you want to see the answers for the board, simply type in `model.ships` in the Developer Tools console, and the arrays will show you the board, and where the ships are.
